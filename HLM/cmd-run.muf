  A free, simple "run" program for Fuzzball 6.
 
  Type "run dir,dir,dir..." to zip through those rooms without actually
  going through them. No, you can't break through locks: they're all
  tested and you're left in the last room you were in before. Everyone
  in the rooms you run through sees intermediate messages, and you see
  lists of all the objects in those rooms--but no descriptions or lists
  of obvious exits {since you already know where you're going, right?}.

Automatically go through the exits and paths given in the order specified. 
For example, instead of going north, north, and east, you could "run n,n,e". 
Use the #view option to see where a certain command will take you. If you 
have a path along which you run a lot, you can #set a short memorable name, 
or path, for it. For example, Natasha runs home from the Peak with 
e,e,s,a,up,2b, so she can "run #set home=e,e,s,a,up,2b" in the Peak and only 
have to type "run home". Paths are only valid in the room in which you #set 
them.
 
Paths can contain other paths. The enclosing path puts you in the room where 
you set the contained path. For example, if you set a path in your home 
called 'cup' that goes 'peak,cup', you would have to set the inner 'cup' path 
wherever the 'peak' path leaves you. However, if a path has its own name for 
its *first* exit, that exit will not be interpreted as a path: if the first 
exit of your 'cup' path is 'cup', you will take the exit named 'cup' if one 
exists.
