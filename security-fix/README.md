# Security Fixes for Old MUFs

This directory contains MUFs that are no longer necessary due to FB7 replacements, but have some sort of known security problem that will impact previous MUCK versions to the point where it is recommended they be upgraded even if there is no intention to upgrade to FB7.

At the time of this writing, the only thing in here is @register -- if you are using FB7, you really don't need this MUF any more as the built-in has all the functionality of the MUF version.
